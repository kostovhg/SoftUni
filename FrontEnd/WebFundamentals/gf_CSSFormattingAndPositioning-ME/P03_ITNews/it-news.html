            <h2>You can preorder Intel's Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X CPUs next week</h2>
            <time>June 14, 2017</time>
            <p>Intel formally introduced its Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X processor lineup at Computex last month, but at
                the time it didn't say anything about a specific release date. It turns out that Intel was waiting for

            <h2>Buy a GTX 1080 or 1080 Ti, get Destiny 2 free with early beta access</h2>
            <time>June 10, 2017</time>
            <p>Nvidia's got a sweet deal lined up for its next graphics card bundle. If you buy a GTX 1080 or 1080 Ti,
                you can snag a free copy of Destiny 2, and get in on the game's PC beta in the process. And it's not
                just any old beta access. It's [Early] Access, according to Nvidia. Why is Early in brackets? Who knows!
                But the point is, you get Destiny 2 and can try it out before the release date on October 24.</p>
